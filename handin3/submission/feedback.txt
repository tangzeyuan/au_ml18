You have done as the handin requested, and little more. 
You have chosen a simple model to implement, 
but you still get decent results in the end. 
You do not have a lot of detail describing your implementation process, 
it would be nice if you wrote a bit more here. 
Your illustration of your model is quite good.

Accepted!
